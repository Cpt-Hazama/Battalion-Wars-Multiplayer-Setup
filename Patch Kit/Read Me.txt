1.1 Things to keep in mind:

	This tutorial is intended for users on a machine running windows  7+
	
	Players must be on the same server to be able to play together.

	In game profiles must be made specifically for use on both the server options:
	If they are not DATA from Wiimmfi can clash with Zwei's for example.
 
	Dolphin users must use the Unbanner Tool, or aqquire a legitimate Wii NAND:
	Not required for Zwei.

	Once you have installed Wiimms ISO Tools please restart your computer.

	When using the Wiimmfi unbanner ensure dolphin is closed!

1.2 What I recomend you do is:

	Create a file and store a completely unmodded/clean copy of your game ISO in it.

	Copy it twice and patch both ISO's one for each server, this saves headaches when:
	server jumping.

	Configure windows explorer to show file extensions:
	1. Open File Explorer
	2. Click on the View Tab at the top of the Window
	3. Check File Extensions	

	Keep this READ ME.txt file, you can always referance it later.
	
1.3 Using the batch program:

	The batch program was scripted in order to work with Drag And Drop so, place it in the same:
	place as your game ISO location.

	Drag the ISO over the .bat file
	
	Read the on screen instructions, you will be prompted to type A or B depending on what:
	server you want your game to be patched with.

	Once you have made that choice the script will run a WIT command and start preforming:
	the patch on your game,.

	IF the batch script posts an error or crashes OPEN CMD and type WIT:
	 a flag screen showing ASCII art of the title WIT should appear, if not re-install Whimms: 
	then reboot.
	

1.4 Preparing your game after the patch:

	Once the patch is complete you will have to do one or two things depending on the server:
	you choose.

	FOR WIIMMFI:
	1. Close all instances of dolphin
	2. Run the UNBANNER program
	3.Start up your game.
	4.Create a NEW save file.
	5.Access the online functions of the game in order to save data to the WIIMMFI server.
	6. Finished .
	NOTE: Part one is skippable if you have a LEGIT NAND loaded in your dolphin configuration.
	NOTE: Mario Kart Wii will require a seperate patch from the Wiimmfi website
	NOTE:  https://wiimmfi.de

	FOR ZWEI (RECOMMENDED):
	1. Start up your game
	2. Create a NEW save file.
	3. Access the online functions of the game in order to save data to the Zwei server.
	4. Finished

1.5 What to do if you still need help?:

	If you still cannot figure out how to PATCH or CONFIGURE your Wii game for use online:
	contact me on the BattalionWars modding discord, I'm willing to screenshare and run:
	through the process with you. (Please make an attempt to do it yourself though.)
