Note that this is a clean rip of the original game, this is uploaded due to shortage of available downloads from other sites and to avoid any ad-ware from some of those sites.

1.) Download and Install Dolphin Emulator (Go ahead and configure your settings too. Ask me for controller configurations if you want as well, I have one for XBox controllers and one for Mouse and Keyboard (Requires Mouse4 and Mouse5 inputs))
2.) Place Battalion Wars 2.iso into your Dolphin Emulator's main directory (or be organized like me and make a games folder which you can make Dolphin scan everytime you start it)
3.) Watch this tutorial for how to restore multiplayer mode to the game (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q6PmeJZ678) I recommend using Zwei servers for this.
4.) Launch the game and enjoy! Note that you must complete the tutorial and mission 5 to unlock multiplayer mode. This is good for understanding the controls of the game and adjusting to whatever configuration you have set. You can also theoretically find a save game online or use Dolphin's cheat menu to skip/speedrun the required missions.
5.) Note that your profile name in-game will be your multiplayer name. You'll know if the MP patch worked if you connect to the main multiplayer screen.
6.) Add me so we can play :) my in-game friend code is: 322 723 146 329 (My name won't appear on your friends list until I accept, otherwise it will show my ID)
